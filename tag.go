Certainly! Let's go through your code step by step to understand the issues and make corrections:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	original := []string{
		"purPle caT",
		"blUe bIrd",
		"reD DOG",
	}
	substring := []string{
		"purple",
		"blue",
		"red",
	}

	for _, s := range original {
		for _, sub := range substring {
			if strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(s), strings.ToLower(sub)) {
				temp := strings.Index(strings.ToLower(s), strings.ToLower(sub))
				target := s[temp+len(sub)]
				fmt.Println(target)
				continue
			} else {
				fmt.Println("target not found")
				break
			}
		}
	}
}
Now, let's go through the issues:

Using strings.Contains and strings.Index: The condition strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(s), strings.ToLower(sub)) checks if the lowercase version of s contains the lowercase version of sub. If this condition is true, you proceed to find the index of sub in the lowercase version of s using strings.Index. However, this can lead to incorrect results because you're altering the case when checking for containment but not when finding the index. You should maintain the case consistency between these operations.
Loop Logic: The continue statement inside the loop will cause the loop to go to the next iteration even if the substring is not found in the current string. This can result in multiple "target not found" messages for a single string in original. Also, using break after printing "target not found" will exit the entire loop, which is not necessary.
Here's a corrected version of your code:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	original := []string{
		"purPle caT",
		"blUe bIrd",
		"reD DOG",
	}
	substring := []string{
		"purple",
		"blue",
		"red",
	}

	for _, s := range original {
		found := false
		for _, sub := range substring {
			if strings.Contains(s, sub) {
				temp := strings.Index(s, sub)
				target := s[temp+len(sub):]
				fmt.Println(target)
				found = true
				break
			}
		}
		if !found {
			fmt.Println("target not found")
		}
	}
}
Changes made:

Removed the conversion to lowercase in strings.Contains and strings.Index to maintain case consistency.
Introduced a boolean variable found to track whether the substring was found in the current string.
Removed unnecessary continue and adjusted the logic to print "target not found" only if the substring is not found in the current string.

You
can you explain the purpose of the added Boolean variable?

Certainly! The added boolean variable found serves the purpose of keeping track of whether the current substring has been found in the current string. Let me break down its role in the code:

go
Copy code
for _, s := range original {
    found := false  // Initialize found to false for each new s
    for _, sub := range substring {
        if strings.Contains(s, sub) {
            temp := strings.Index(s, sub)
            target := s[temp+len(sub):]
            fmt.Println(target)
            found = true  // Set found to true when substring is found
            break
        }
    }
    if !found {
        fmt.Println("target not found")  // Print if substring is not found in s
    }
}
Here's how it works:

Initialization: Before checking each substring in the inner loop, we set found to false. This assumes that the substring has not been found in the current string.
Inner Loop: Inside the inner loop, we check if the current substring is contained in the current string using strings.Contains(s, sub). If it is, we update found to true and print the target substring.
Break Statement: After finding and processing the substring in the inner loop, we use break to exit the inner loop immediately. This prevents unnecessary iterations through the remaining substrings in the substring slice.
Check After Inner Loop: After the inner loop, we check the value of found. If it is still false, it means that none of the substrings were found in the current string. In this case, we print "target not found."
This approach ensures that we print "target not found" only if none of the substrings are found in the current string. If at least one substring is found, found will be set to true during the inner loop, and we won't print "target not found" for that particular string.
